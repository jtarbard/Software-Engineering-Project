                <h2>About the Vertex</h2>
                <p>
                    The Vertex is a large sports centre based in north-west Leeds.
                    Founded in 2000 to meet the needs of Leeds' ever-growing population the centre began with a medium
                    sized gym, pool and outside grounds and has since undergone multiple refurbishments and extensions.
                    The Vertex is now home to a state of the art gym, olympic sized swimming pool, large studio, two
                    sports halls, a tennis court, a climbing wall, and an extensive outside playing field making the
                    Vertex one of the best equipped sports centres in the north of England.
